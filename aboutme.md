I'm Andrea, a Software Engineer at Google Zürich. I have a Master's Degree in Computer Science from ETH Zürich, where I specialized in Data Engineering and Machine Learning. I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems at internet scale, and I'm always looking for new challenges.

I'm currently working on [Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/intl/it_it/start/overview-ha/?subid=it-it-ha-aw-bk-c-bau!o3~CjwKCAjw8ZKmBhArEiwAspcJ7o4E_Xo1eD2_pntABh6OI6dA-ZJwlOqpRZv9j2YvnRwOT36P8Ckr4hoCHPcQAvD_BwE~110532346943~kwd-94527731~11438680053~598749884761&utm_source=aw&utm_medium=ha&utm_campaign=it-it-ha-aw-bk-c-bau!o3~CjwKCAjw8ZKmBhArEiwAspcJ7o4E_Xo1eD2_pntABh6OI6dA-ZJwlOqpRZv9j2YvnRwOT36P8Ckr4hoCHPcQAvD_BwE~110532346943~kwd-94527731~11438680053~598749884761&gclid=CjwKCAjw8ZKmBhArEiwAspcJ7o4E_Xo1eD2_pntABh6OI6dA-ZJwlOqpRZv9j2YvnRwOT36P8Ckr4hoCHPcQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). Mainly focusing on building and optimizing data pipelines and servers to process billions of data every day. These pipelines are used to power a variety of products, including the Google Ads UI and the Google Ads API, hence, empowering millions of advertisers.

During my Master studies I have been the pleasure of conducting my thesis at the [AIT Lab](https://ait.ethz.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof. Otmar Hilliges](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-epU9OsAAAAJ&hl=en). The project resulted in a publication ["TempCLR: Reconstructing Hands via Time Coherent Contrastive Learning"](https://eth-ait.github.io/tempclr/) accepted as poster presentation at the International Conference on 3D Vision 2022.

Previous to that, I conducted some research at Oracle Labs Zürich. There, I developed a machine learning-powered fuzzy matching algorithm for [Financial Crimes and Compliance Studio](https://www.oracle.com/financial-services/aml-financial-crime-compliance/crime-compliance-studio/). This algorithm was used to match customer data across multiple sources, improving the accuracy of financial crime investigations. 

I also interned at Goldman Sachs as an Engineering Analyst, where I built a monitoring tool for automatic trading platforms. This tool helped to identify and troubleshoot performance issues in the trading platforms, improving the reliability of the trading systems.

In my spare time, I enjoy singing and playing the guitar. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.
