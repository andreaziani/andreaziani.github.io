subtitle: A little bit of my story

Hi, I'm Andrea, a Software Engineer at Google Zürich. I have a Master's Degree in Computer Science from ETH Zurich, where I specialized in Data Engineering and Machine Learning. I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, and I'm always looking for new challenges.

I'm currently working on Google Ads. Mainly focusing on building and optimizing data pipelines and servers to process billions of data every day. These pipelines are used to power a variety of Google Ads products, including the Google Ads UI, Google Ads API and several other reporting tools :)

Previously, I was an intern at Oracle Labs, I developed a machine learning-powered fuzzy matching algorithm for the Financial Crimes and Compliance Studio product. This algorithm was used to match customer data across multiple sources, which helped to improve the accuracy of financial crime investigations. 

I also interned at Goldman Sachs as an Engineering Analyst, where I built a monitoring tool for automatic trading platforms. This tool helped to identify and troubleshoot performance issues in the trading platforms, which helped to improve the reliability of the trading systems.

In my spare time, I enjoy singing and playing the guitar. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.

Here are some of my skills and experience:

- Software Engineering
- Data Engineering
- Machine Learning
- Big Data
- Advanced Algorithms
- Object Oriented Programming and design patterns
- Spark
- Hadoop
- Web API
- Python
- C/C++
- Java
- SQL
- Protocol buffers (and almost every other format :) )
- Linux
- MacOS
- A little bit of Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure

If you're interested in working with me, please feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to chat about new projects and opportunities.

Thank you for reading!
