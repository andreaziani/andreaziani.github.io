I'm Andrea, a Machine Learning Software Engineer at Google Zürich. My background is in Data Engineering and Machine Learning, with a Master's Degree in Computer Science from ETH Zürich. During my studies, I conducted research at the [AIT Lab](https://ait.ethz.ch/) under the supervision of Prof. Otmar Hilliges, resulting in a publication titled ["TempCLR: Reconstructing Hands via Time Coherent Contrastive Learning"](https://eth-ait.github.io/tempclr/) presented at the International Conference on 3D Vision 2022. I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems at internet scale, and I'm always looking for new challenges.

# Experience in Machine Learning and Data Engineering

I'm currently part of Google Cloud AI, where I'm dedicated to improving our Machine Learning models' ability to detect novel money laundering patterns.  Furthermore, I focus on generating explanations to aid bank investigators in their efforts to apprehend financial criminals.  See [Anti-Money Laundering AI](https://cloud.google.com/anti-money-laundering-ai) to learn more.

Previously, I worked on [Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/intl/it_it/start/overview-ha/?subid=it-it-ha-aw-bk-c-bau!o3~CjwKCAjw8ZKmBhArEiwAspcJ7o4E_Xo1eD2_pntABh6OI6dA-ZJwlOqpRZv9j2YvnRwOT36P8Ckr4hoCHPcQAvD_BwE~110532346943~kwd-94527731~11438680053~598749884761&utm_source=aw&utm_medium=ha&utm_campaign=it-it-ha-aw-bk-c-bau!o3~CjwKCAjw8ZKmBhArEiwAspcJ7o4E_Xo1eD2_pntABh6OI6dA-ZJwlOqpRZv9j2YvnRwOT36P8Ckr4hoCHPcQAvD_BwE~110532346943~kwd-94527731~11438680053~598749884761&gclid=CjwKCAjw8ZKmBhArEiwAspcJ7o4E_Xo1eD2_pntABh6OI6dA-ZJwlOqpRZv9j2YvnRwOT36P8Ckr4hoCHPcQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). Mainly focusing on building and optimizing data pipelines and servers to process billions of data every day. These pipelines are used to power a variety of products, including the Google Ads UI and the Google Ads API, hence, empowering millions of advertisers.

Before joining Google, I gained valuable experience in various Machine Learning and Data Engineering roles. Here are some highlights:

* Oracle Labs Zürich: I developed a machine learning algorithm for matching customer data across data sources, improving the accuracy of financial crime investigations (see [Financial Crimes and Compliance Studio](https://www.oracle.com/financial-services/aml-financial-crime-compliance/crime-compliance-studio/)). See [US Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230350903A1/en) application of a novel approach for address matching 
* Goldman Sachs: I built a monitoring tool to identify and troubleshoot performance issues in automated trading platforms, ensuring the reliability of their trading systems.
