Hi, I'm Andrea, a Software Engineer at Google Zürich. I have a Master's Degree in Computer Science from ETH Zürich, where I specialized in Data Engineering and Machine Learning. I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, and I'm always looking for new challenges.

I'm currently working on [Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/intl/it_it/start/overview-ha/?subid=it-it-ha-aw-bk-c-bau!o3~CjwKCAjw8ZKmBhArEiwAspcJ7o4E_Xo1eD2_pntABh6OI6dA-ZJwlOqpRZv9j2YvnRwOT36P8Ckr4hoCHPcQAvD_BwE~110532346943~kwd-94527731~11438680053~598749884761&utm_source=aw&utm_medium=ha&utm_campaign=it-it-ha-aw-bk-c-bau!o3~CjwKCAjw8ZKmBhArEiwAspcJ7o4E_Xo1eD2_pntABh6OI6dA-ZJwlOqpRZv9j2YvnRwOT36P8Ckr4hoCHPcQAvD_BwE~110532346943~kwd-94527731~11438680053~598749884761&gclid=CjwKCAjw8ZKmBhArEiwAspcJ7o4E_Xo1eD2_pntABh6OI6dA-ZJwlOqpRZv9j2YvnRwOT36P8Ckr4hoCHPcQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). Mainly focusing on building and optimizing data pipelines and servers to process billions of data every day. These pipelines are used to power a variety of Google Ads products, including the Google Ads UI, Google Ads API and empower millions of advertisers :) 

Previous to that, I did some research at Oracle Labs. There, I developed a machine learning-powered fuzzy matching algorithm for the [Financial Crimes and Compliance Studio](https://www.oracle.com/financial-services/aml-financial-crime-compliance/crime-compliance-studio/). This algorithm was used to match customer data across multiple sources, which helped to improve the accuracy of financial crime investigations. 

I also interned at Goldman Sachs as an Engineering Analyst, where I built a monitoring tool for automatic trading platforms. This tool helped to identify and troubleshoot performance issues in the trading platforms, which helped to improve the reliability of the trading systems.

In my spare time, I enjoy singing and playing the guitar. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.
